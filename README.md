# What is this?
This is part of a game called "Mestre dos cÃ³digos" to validate knowledges about some programming languages.

# How to run this project.

## Requirements
 - Visual Studio 2019 / VSCode / Rider
 - .Net Core 3.1

## How to run

### VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Choose File -> Open folder...
3. Navigate to code folder
Now you can see all exercises written

To run each one, just open a terminal, navigate to project folder and type: dotnet run

You also can type: dotnet run -p .\App\Folder\, specifying the app's folder code or project.

### Visual Studio 2019
1. Open Visual Studio 2019
If you use the Start Window, choose "Open a project or solution". 
If no:
2. Choose File -> Open -> Project/Solution...
3. Go to code folder
4. Select the MestreDosCodigosNetEscudeiro.sln solution file
5. Build the solution
6. Run projects one by one

You may don't see the "run" options if you choose to open a folder or if you do something wrong.

In this case, I advice you to use VSCode and run the applications at terminal.

### Rider

I don't have a clue
